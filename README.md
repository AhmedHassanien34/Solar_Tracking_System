# Solar_Tracking_System
The project was aimed to develop a dual axis solar tracking system using LDRs and Servo Motors. Entire design was written and coded using Eclipse IDE. Coding was done in C language, Atmega16A is the microcontroller on which the project is running.

The design uses ADCs and PWM generators avaiable on the microcontroller. Testing of the project was done in ambient light with a lamp source, which it was tracking to.
